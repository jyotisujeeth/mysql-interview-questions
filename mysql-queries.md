Triggers

CREATE OR MODIFY TRIGGER trigger_name
WHEN EVENT

ON table_name TRIGGER_TYPE

EXECUTE stored_procedure
WHEN:

BEFORE – invoke before the event occurs
AFTER – invoke after the event occurs
EVENT:

INSERT – invoke for insert
UPDATE – invoke for update
DELETE – invoke for delete
TRIGGER_TYPE:

FOR EACH ROW
FOR EACH STATEMENT
!-- Delete a specific trigger
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name

Stored Routine
/***
A stored routine is a set of SQL statements that are stored on the database server and can be used by any client 
with permission to use them. This provides a number of benefits. 

1. Database operations are normalized so various applications will operate uniformly, even when written in different 
   languages and operating on different platforms. 
   
2. Stored routines are easy to maintain, because they're all in one place rather than distributed among different applications.

3. Traffic is reduced between the client and server, because data is processed on the server.

4. security is enhanced by allowing clients to run with reduced permissions while still being able to perform necessary 
   database operations. 
   
There are also some disadvantages. 

1. Migration to a different server platform can be difficult as stored routines tend to use a lot of platform specific 
   features and codes. 
   
2. stored procedures can be difficult to debug and maintain. 

There are two different kinds of stored routines. 

a) Stored functions return a value, and are used in the context of an expression.

b) Stored procedures are called separately, using the call statement, and may return result sets or set variables.
